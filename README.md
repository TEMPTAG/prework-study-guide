# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The motivation for this project was to be introduced to the 4 main elements of web development, and when complete have a place to store and reference the notes taken during my coding education.  

I built this project as it was an exceptional guide to the 4 main elements of web development; including installing the tools, programs and systems on local and cloud drives.  It gave me the opportunity to start learning web development in a logical and properly guided format.

Through building this project, it allowed me to familiarize myself with not only the elements and programs individually, but also how they all interact.  It provided me the challenges to follow the instructions, as well as troubleshoot issues using the knowledge gained, researching the resources provided, and searching for solutions to unique issues that arose in the learing process... as us newbs creat a lot of them!

I learned a great deal creating this application... tons surrounding new tools, programs, languages, and processes I did not know about, and I also learned that I can gain new skills by putting myself outside of my comfort zone.

## Usage

Each section (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git) contain notes that, to me, were helpful in remembering what they are, do, and links to assets I can reference in the future to dig further into the topcis.  This collection of notes will grow over time and will servce not only as a reference, but a point of where it all begain.  Hopefully I will look back in the future and can see how far I have come!

For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
